## Desription of App Functionality, Features, and Methods

Javascript coding project I completed from Udemy - The Complete Javascript Course 2023: From Zero to Expert by Jonas Schmedtmann. After coding this project through the course I then added additional commenting of the code for educational purposes.

App can be run from: https://frank-pechar-js-mapty.netlify.app/

## App Functionality 

Log a Workout

- Click on the map where the workout was located
- A form will popup - Enter workout Type: Running or Cycling, Distance, Duration, and Cadence (for running) or Elev Gain (for cycling) - Press Enter
- Workout data will be displayed in a list and the map with a Location Marker
- Clicking on a workout list item will center the map on that marker location
- Closing the App window or browser and then restarting the App in the browser will cause the Workout Data to be re-displayed because the data is stored in the browser local storage area
